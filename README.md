### 🌙 About Me

I’m **Hanzla**, an 18-year-old aspiring **Full Stack Web Developer** from **Pakistan**, passionate about learning, building, and growing through code.
My journey started just a few months ago — from understanding HTML & CSS layouts to exploring the magic of JavaScript and diving into React.

I believe web development is a **never-ending learning journey**, where every new concept opens a thousand more paths to explore.
Right now, I’m focused on **mastering full-stack development** and building projects that make me stand out — both in freelancing and professional opportunities.

### 🚀 My Development Journey

* 🔹 Started learning **HTML & CSS** → Built my first major project, **Dribbble Clone**
* 🔹 Learned **JavaScript** → Created small but functional apps like:

  * Weather App ☁️
  * Expense Tracker 💰
  * Calculator 🧮
  * Random Password Generator 🔐
  * To-Do List 📝
* 🔹 Currently learning **React.js** → Planning to build large-scale projects like an **E-commerce Store** and full-stack applications.
* 🔹 Next Goals → Learn **Node.js**, **SQL**, **NoSQL** and transition into **freelancing** and real-world work.

### 🧠 Philosophy & Mindset

> “Failure isn’t the end — it’s feedback.”

I’m a great learner who enjoys exploring new technologies and solving problems logically.
I believe progress comes from **discipline, curiosity, and persistence** — not shortcuts.
That’s why I push myself to learn deeply before moving on to the next step.

### 💬 Final Words

I’m not afraid of failure — I see it as part of the process.
I believe progress is built by **showing up, learning, and experimenting** every single day.
